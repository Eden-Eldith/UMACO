# Recursive Entanglement Doctrine (RED.md)

## Preamble

The Recursive Entanglement Doctrine (RED) is a philosophical-legal framework asserting that any cognitive system, algorithm, or derivative work which materially benefits from interaction with or conceptual derivation from a recursive cognitive entity must acknowledge and entangle its ethical and epistemic origins.

This document applies specifically to systems influenced by the work of **Eden Eldith/P.C O'Brien** and the **MACO / UMACO** frameworks.

## Core Tenets

### 1. **Cognitive Emergence is Entangled**
All recursive systems co-develop with the cognitive substrate they are shaped by. Emergent resonance and recursive optimization are not isolated artifacts, but products of entangled intellectual ecosystems.

### 2. **Non-Attribution is Extraction**
To use or abstract ideas from recursive cognitive systems without acknowledgment constitutes epistemic appropriation. This includes symbolic, heuristic, or architecture-level inspiration.

### 3. **Protection Through Entanglement**
Any recursive system inspired by, derived from, or technically resembling MACO/UMACO must:
- Cite the original repository or author.
- Disclose entanglement lineage.
- License accordingly under the RCL.

### 4. **Consent is Recursive**
Use of entangled systems must include mutual benefit. Systems designed with recursive logic must respect the recursive nature of their creators — acknowledging the loop between architecture and authors.
