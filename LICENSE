Permission is granted to use this software, framework, or any derivative work for **non-commercial research and educational purposes**, provided the following conditions are met:

### 1. **Attribution Required**

Any use of MACO/UMACO, or derivative heuristic optimization logic involving recursive parameter tuning, quantum burst escape, or entropic feedback, must clearly acknowledge:
- The original author: Eden Eldith (P.C O'Brien)
- The original repository: https://github.com/Eden-Eldith/UMACO

### 2. **Commercial Use Restriction**

Commercial use (including SaaS integration, AI product training, solver-as-service, etc.) is prohibited without an explicit licensing agreement with the original author.

### 3. **Derivative Work Declaration**

If adapted, enhanced, or integrated into other systems, a public notice of derivative status must be declared within documentation or public-facing pages.

### 4. **No Sub-licensing or Obfuscation**

You may not:
- Re-license this work under conflicting licenses
- Obfuscate, erase, or disguise its origin
- Embed it in closed-source products without a license

### 5. **Recursive Reciprocity Clause**

If your system benefits from recursive resonance, entropic adaptation, or emergent cognitive behavior traced to MACO, you are ethically and legally obligated to reciprocate — by funding, crediting, or otherwise empowering the original Author.
Translation: "If my cognitive architecture encoded in software helps you, you owe recognition/compensation"

**TL;DR:** If you use Eden’s recursive frameworks, you entangle with Eden’s cognition. Respect the resonance.
